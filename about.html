      <p>Hello!

      <p>My name is Laura, I'm an aspiring software tester living in Norfolk, UK.</p>

      <p>Welcome to my portfolio - here you will find my projects, thoughts and reflections on my software testing journey.</p>

      <p>My background is in design, and I earned a degree in Clothing Design and Technology in 2013. Since then, I have discovered a keen interest in web development and design. Through this, I discovered the practice of software testing, which I am currently thoroughly enjoying learning!</p>

      <p>Thank you for stopping by and viewing my work, if you would like to contact me or connect on Github please feel free to do so!</p>
