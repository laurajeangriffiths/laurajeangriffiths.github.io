    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>Welcome to my online portfolio - a place to document my projects, my thoughts and keep track of my progression in learning software testing.</p>

    <p>My name is Laura. I am from the UK and currently living in the lovely Norfolk countryside!
    My background is in clothing design and technology, but after some dabbling in web development, I've decided to dive into software testing. I love to learn and have projects on the go, so I'm excited to get stuck in!</p>

    <p>Thanks so much for stopping by, I hope to update with new content regularly!</p>
