    <p>Hello! I'm Laura.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio - here you will find my projects, thoughts and reflections on my software testing journey.</p>

    <p>I've been using my time in Covid-19 lockdown to finally make time for my passion - tech, and get stuck into learning about software testing.</p>

    <p>I come from a design background, earning a degree in Clothing Design and Technology in 2013. Since then, I have discovered a keen interest in web development and design, and most recently, software testing. I am using my spare time to work through courses, get familiar with programming languages and practice my testing skills by contributing to crowdtesting projects.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to view my work, if you would like to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me please get in touch.</p>
