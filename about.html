    <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

    <p>Here you can find my projects, thoughts and progression through my software testing journey.</p>

    <p>My name is Laura, I am from the UK and currently reside in the lovely Norfolk countryside.</p>

    <p>My background is in design, and although I earned a degree in clothing design and technology in 2013, I have discovered a keen interest in web development. Through this, I discovered the practice of software testing, and I am currently thoroughly enjoying throwing myself into this practice!</p>

    <p>Thank you for stopping by, if you would like to contact me or connect on Github please feel free to do so!</p>
