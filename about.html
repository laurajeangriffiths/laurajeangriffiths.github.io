    <p>Hello!

    <p>I'm Laura, an aspiring software tester living in Norfolk, UK.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio - here you will find my projects, thoughts and reflections on my software testing journey.</p>

    <p>I come from a design background, earning a degree in Clothing Design and Technology in 2013. Since then, I have discovered a keen interest in web development and design. Through this, I found the practice of software testing and I am currently enjoying discovering and learning more about the craft.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to view my work, if you would like to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me or connect on social media please feel free to do so!</p>
