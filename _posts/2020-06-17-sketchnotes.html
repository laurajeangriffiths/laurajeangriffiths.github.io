    <p>These sketchnotes document the exploratory testing carried out on the Restful Booker API.</p>
    <p>Using the results from the risk analysis as prompts, I began to jot down ideas for areas of exploration. For example, one requriement stated in the user stories was that the user should have the ability to delete bookings. So an obvious charter was the explore the delete functionality. This then led to further exploration around authenticity and login credentials.</p>
    <p>The sketchnotes shown here provide an overview of the various features that I explored, and how these then led to even further exploration and discover.</p>
