<h3>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>

<p>I'm Laura, an aspiring software tester from the UK, currently on my learning journey.</p>

<p>I built this website to act as a portfolio of my work. This space will be used to document my projects, thoughts and keep track of my progression.</p>

<p>If you'd like to know more about me then pop on over to the <a href="/about/">about</a> page. If you'd like to contact me, or connect on social media, you can find all my details <a href="/contact/">here</a>.</p>
