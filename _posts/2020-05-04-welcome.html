<h3>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>

<p>My name is Laura, I am a software testing student from the UK.</p>

<p>If you'd like to know more about me then pop on over to the <a href="/about/">about</a> page. If you'd like to contact me, or connect on social media, you can find all my details <a href="/contact/">here</a>.</p>
