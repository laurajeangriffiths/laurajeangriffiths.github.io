  <p>Creating the summary report allowed me to reflect on my testing - what I learned from it, the quality of testing, what went well, and what didn't.
    I used my bug reports to help me decide which bugs posed the most risk to quality, and then referenced these in my summary report.
    The report provided a summary of findings from testing, insight into the state of the software and its strengths and weaknesses, with the intent to help
    inform decision making on whether to address defects that could impact on the quality.
    Writing a report was a little different for communicating findings from exploratory testing as rather than documenting pass and fail rates,
    such as in test cases, it became more a case of telling the testing story and documenting the processes, lines of thought, session lengths,
    the testing journey, and rather than providing pass/fail statistics, providing a grading system for defects and performance.
    From having created a summary report, I can appreciate its value in helping to communicate the state of the software,
    and its contribution to advocating for quality.
