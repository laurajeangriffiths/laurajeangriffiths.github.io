  <p>I used my bug reports to sort and decide which imposed the most risk to quality, and then referenced these in my testing summary report.
    This report served as a summary of findings from testing, providing information on things that went well, as well as things that
    didn't perform as well. The intention is to provide the product owner with information about the current state of the software,
    and allow them to make an informed decision on whether to progress with release, or take some addtional time to fix defects
