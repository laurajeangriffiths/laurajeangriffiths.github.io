    <p>After finishing the exploratory testing project, it was time to move on to test automation. My first task was to use
      Postman to create some basic automated tests. I was already familiar with using Postman to send manual tests to the Restful
      Booker API, so now it was time to automate!</p>

    <p>I was given a brief introduction to creating tests with Postman, and then assigned homework to automate the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a booking that will then be deleted</li>
      <li>Post a booking and confirm that the values sent are the same values returned</li>
      <li>Quickly create 10 bookings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although these tests were fairly simple, I made sure to only ever use one codified oracle per test in order to keep the intent targeted.
      For example when testing that the returned values matched those sent, I checked each part of the booking separately in it's own test,
      such as first name, last name, check in date, check out date, rather than the entire response body in one test.</p>

  <p>The next step was to begin looking at more complex tests, utilising new software and tools, as well as a new language - Java.
    To prepare, I completed the Ministry of Testing <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/courses/introduction-to-java-mike-talks" alt="Link to Ministry of Testing Introduction to Java course">Introduction to Java</a>
    and <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/courses/selenium-webdriver-api-introduction-in-java-richard-bradshaw" alt="Ministry of Tesing Selenium WebDriver API Introduction in Java course">Selenium WebDriver API Introduction in Java</a> courses.
  </p>

  <p>After completing the courses, I was better prepared to tackle my larger project: using Selenium WebDriver to automate testing of the
    <a href="https://automationintesting.online/#/" alt="Link to the Restful Booker Platform">Restful Booker Platform's</a> login and room creation forms. Everything in the project was completely new to me - Java, IntelliJ, Selenium, JUnit, so it was definitely
    a challenge, but it was a great feeling to finally see all my tests run! I created just a few tests, but I tried to make these
    targeted, so that if issues arose, it was easier to identify where the problem occurred. You can find my code <a href="https://github.com/laurajeangriffiths/Test-Automation-Example" alt="Link to test automation code on Github">here</a>.
