<p>An early activity in my learning was to provide a definition of what software testing is. The activity was designed to encourage thought and consideration of the nature of the role, and to put these thoughts into my own words.</p>

<p>This is mine:</p>

<em>"Testing is the process of improving a software product or feature by seeking information and addressing risks. Identifying possible risks at all stages of development increases the likelihood of the software functioning as intended. Identifying and testing for risks at an early stage is beneficial to the SD process as it saves time on reworking later down the line. Software intended for business that contains issues could be detrimental to the reputation of the business as well as it's revenue. Premeditating and investigating not only things that are likely to, or are problematic, but also to think outside the box and search deeper. Ultimately, the process of testing is the seeking of information in order to improve software."</em>
