  <p class="br1">After conducting various testing charters and creating a visual mindmap, I logged the bugs found in reports.
    These are detailed reports allowing for another tester or developer to follow the steps to reproduce the bug and implement fixes.
    I have included a couple of examples from my testing:
  </p>

  <p class="br2">The report documents a defect around formatting. When creating a booking via a POST request, the name fields cannot
    be left empty, however, when updating a booking via a PATCH request, the name fields can be deleted and left blank. This poses a risk
    to the consistency quality characteristic, as the two methods each have different formatting rules, could be problematic for the
    user when trying to retrieve data.
  </p>

  <p class="br3">This report gives information on a critical defect, as this particular bug explicitly prohibits one of the functions
    stated in the user stories - the ability to filter bookings by dates.
    Providing the exact dates of a stored booking returns either incorrect, or no results at all.
    When I discovered this issue during exploratory testing, I deepened my testing to try to discover the behaviour of the API when
    provided only a check in date, only a check out date, or both a check in and check out date. I found that searching via a check
    in date returned bookings with check in dates greater than, but not including the date specified. Searching via check out date
    returned bookings with check out dates equal to, and prior to the date specified.
