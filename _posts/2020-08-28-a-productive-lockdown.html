    <p>I think it's obvious to say that 2020 has not gone as planned for most. The Covid-19 pandemic forced us all into a very
    alien situation that brought with it a whole host of unexpected emotions and a new "normal". My 2020 started with a dream
  trip to Southeast Asia which, to cut a long story short, had to be cut short at the end of March, about 6 weeks earlier than planned.
  I quickly found myself back home with no employment and quite literally isolated at home - quite different to my original plan
  for returning home to the UK! A country-wide lockdown, plus all the
  additional jobhunters sadly made redundant, made the prospect of seeking new employment quite daunting.
  </p>

  <p>Suddenly finding myself in a situation with a lot of time on my hands, I aimed to use this opportunity to my advantage
    and learn new skills. For me, it was really important that I use this time wisely and in a meaningful way. In recent years,
    I've discovered a real interest in web design and development, really enjoying the challenges that come with learning a
    completely new set of skills and languages. Back in 2018 I completed a self-study bootcamp in web development, which I really enjoyed but found it hard
     to combine regular study with the full time job that I had at the time. I'm fortunate to know an experienced software tester
     who now works in training testers, so when he offered to tutor me in the fundamentals of testing to see if this was
     something I'd enjoy, I jumped at the opportunity. Alongside his tuition and exercises, I've been able to work through
     various courses and practice exercises.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, I've been lucky to say that lockdown actually worked out in my favour, finally giving me the time to really
  dive into learning more skills. Alongside my courses and tasks,
  I've also put my skills into practice by contributing to crowdtesting projects. I'm really happy with what I have achieved
  over this period, and thoroughly enjoyed all the courses I took as well as the work I have completed. There have been
  challenges, but I love to find ways to overcome obstacles, and really enjoy always having a project on the go!</p>
