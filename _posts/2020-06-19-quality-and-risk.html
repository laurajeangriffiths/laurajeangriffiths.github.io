  Following on from my post titled 'What is quality', in this post I will cover the process of

  The first step in my testing process, was to assess the main quality charactersitics, and along with the user stories, conduct a risk analysis.

  I was tasked with choosing 3 quality characteristics, these were:
  </div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Quality Characteristic</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Accuracy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>User Friendliness</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Consistency</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  Along with these characteristics, I identified requirements in the user stories and used these to conduct a risk analysis.
  I noted down my thoughts around hypothetical scenarios and possible risks and used these to draw up my charters.

  Examples of charters. why looking at them?

  <table>
    <th colspan="2">Project information</th>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <td>May 2020</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Course</th>
      <td><a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/essentials">https://www.ministryoftesting.com/essentials</a></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
