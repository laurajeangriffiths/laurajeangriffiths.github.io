<h3>And why it matters</h3>

<!-- <em>"Quality is value to some person who matters at some point in time".</em>

<p>The above definition of quality, originally by Gerald Weinberg, then extended by James Bach & Michael Bolton, and in it's <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/the-quality-and-testing-information-model">final iteration</a> here by David Greenlees, was given early in my learning in order to highlight that quality is relative.</p>
<p>Quality changes over time, and depends on the context.</p>

<p>Delivering on quality is achieved by appeasing the desires of the end user.</p>
<p>In order to deliver quality, it is necessary to identify who the end user is, and discover what matters to them, as well as their expectations.
  To discover this information, it is important to have conversations with the user that uncover their wants, needs and requirements.

Through a range of practice exercises, I identified the main quality characteristics required, and from there carried out a risk analysis by identifying hypothetical scenarios that could negatively impact on the quality.
table with hotel booking app example:

to me quality is how well a rhing meets the needs/req/wants of the intended user. quality is not perfection, as this is unattainable, and again is relative, so perfect cannot mean/look the same to everyon. -->
<!-- <p>3.	To assess quality, relating to:
a.	The software meeting expectations
b.	The goodness of the experience of using the software

think of the end user's experience - usability, performance etc
quality is affected by risk. Carry out a risk analysis identifying areas/things that could affect the quality characterisitcs
risk analaysis - hypothetical scenarios affecting quality, pick out key quality factors and ask questions that coudl incolve risk in that area

•	Testing should uncover the quality and value of the software – is it good enough?

Testing discovers information, which can lead to improved quality and a better product.</p> -->
