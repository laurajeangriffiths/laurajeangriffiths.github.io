<h3>And why it matters</h3>

<div class="container-1">
  <div class="quality-text"
    <p><em>"Quality is value to some person who matters at some point in time".</em></p>

    <p>The above definition of quality, originally by Gerald Weinberg, then extended upon by James Bach & Michael Bolton, and here in it's <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/the-quality-and-testing-information-model">final iteration</a> by David Greenlees, was given early in my learning journey in order to highlight the notion that quality is relative.</p>
    <p>Quality changes over time, and depends on context. It is determined by the end user, so in order to deliver quality, it is necessary to identify that user, discover what matters to them, as well as their expectations. It is the end user who is the judge of quality, so keeping in mind their experience and meeting their requirements is essential. Having conversations helps us discover information about the user, and their requirements.
    </p>

    <p>Testing then enables us to discover information about the software, which can lead to improved quality through implementing changes that would be beneficial to the end user.</p>

    <p>Quality can be affected by risk, and a good way to consider and uncover potential risks is through a risk analysis. This process involves idenifying the key quality characteristics, as well as possible risks and hypothetical scenarios where quality could be affected.</p>

    <p>I have included one of my practice exercises, where I was tasked with identifying the main quality characteristics of a hotel booking app, and using these, consider hypothetical scenarios that could negatively impact on quality.</p>
