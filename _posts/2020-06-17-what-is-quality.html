<h3>And why it matters</h3>

<div class="container-1">
  <div class="quality-text">
    <p><em>"Quality is value to some person who matters at some point in time".</em></p>

    <p>The above definition of quality, originally by Gerald Weinberg, then extended upon by James Bach & Michael Bolton, and <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/the-quality-and-testing-information-model">here</a> in it's final iteration by David Greenlees, was given early in my learning journey in order to highlight the notion that quality is relative.</p>
    <p>Quality changes over time, and depends on context. It is determined by the end user, so in order to deliver quality, it is important to identify with that end user, and have conversations that uncover information about what matters to them, their expectations and their requirements.
    </p>

    <p>Testing then enables us to discover information about the software, which can lead to improved quality through implementing changes that would be beneficial to the end user.</p>

    <p>Quality can be affected by risk, and a technique that I used to consider and uncover potential risks was conducting a risk analysis. This process involved idenifying the key quality characteristics, and possible risks and hypothetical scenarios that could negatively affect those qualities.</p>

    <p>The table highlights one of my practice exercises, broadly identifying the main quality characteristics of the booking feature of a hotel booking app, and using these to consider possible risks and hypothetical scenarios that could negatively impact on quality.</p>
