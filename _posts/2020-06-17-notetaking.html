    <p>This mindmap documents the exploratory testing carried out on the Restful Booker API.</p>
    <p>Using the results from the risk analysis as prompts, I began to jot down ideas for areas of exploration. For example, one requirement of the user stories was that the user should have the ability to delete bookings. So an obvious charter was to explore the delete functionality - does it work? Is the deleted booking actually deleted? This then led to further exploration around authentication and a discovered status code issue.</p>
    <p>This mindmap provides an overview of the various features that I explored, and how these then led to further exploration and discovery.</p>
